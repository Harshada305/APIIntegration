Stock Market API Integration in Node.js

A detailed explanation of what we have written in the above code

First of all, we have added the options variable to our Server.js file, which contain all the details related to the API.
Then we have used app.post(“/data”, function(){}) to handle post request on the /data route.
Then, we have fetched the form data that has come with the post request(using req.body), and .stockSelected tells the value that the user has entered in the dropdown(or basically selected from the dropdown).
The value of that particular stock (in the HTML form which we created in step2) is named in accordance with its respective symbol(to make the work easier for you). For example, (in the Index.html file), the second option in the drop-down is of the stock “INFOSYS”, represented by “<option value=”INFY”>INFOSYS</option>”. Here, the value of INFOSYS is given as INFY which is the symbol of the respective stock. Similarly, the fifth option in drop-down is “ICICI Bank”, having the stock-symbol “ICICIBANK“, thus, we named the value corresponding to the stock as it’s symbol name(“<option value=”ICICIBANK”>ICICI Bank</option>“).
We have intentionally written all the values(in the drop-down option tag) in accordance with their symbols to make everything simple for you.

In short, when we write req.body.stockSelected, it basically represents the symbol of that corresponding stock and we can use that symbol to extract the required data from the API response.

Finally, we make an API request, fetch the data of stock that the user has selected(which is determined using the above step), and log that data in the console.
